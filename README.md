## About arXiv
[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) is a project by the Cornell University Library that provides open access to 1,000,000+ articles in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance, and Statistics.

They have [an API](http://arxiv.org/help/api/index) that uses ATOM feeds to serve simple database queries.
Unfortunately, handling these ATOM requsts can be clumsy (especially given inconsistency in data between different result objects, even in the same query).
This is where arxiv.py comes it: it constructs requests for arXiv and gets ATOM feeds via a simple handful of methods, and parses the results into an intuitive format.

Cool demos hopefully coming soon!
